    FLEXBOX layout is a single direction layout concept aims on providing the efficient way to layout, align and distribute space amoung items within a container even when their size is unknown.
        Flexbox is intended to small scale layouts.
        Flex layout is based on the flex-direction
    Flex layout consists of the following
        Main Axis - main start & end ( not horizontal depends upon flex direction)
        Cross Axis - cross start & end ( not vertical depends upon flex direction)
            main size - height or width between main start and end
            cross size - height or width between cross start and end
