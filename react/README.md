# ReactJs

Reactjs helps to build interactive UI. Design simple views for each state in your application. It efficiently updates and renders just the right component when there is a change in the data. Builds encapsulated components that manage their own state then compose them to form complex UIs. React can also render on the server using Nodejs and power mobile apps (REACT NATIVE).
